Reality outside humans as an [axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom)

A reality outside of the direct control of individuals exists

It can be observed by human beings. Some observations seems to be universal and ought to be commonly acknowledged.

Tentative list:
- Time only moves forward ("the past is the past")
- Human bodies and brains are limited in speed


## In case of violation 

Violation of this axiom means acting by assuming against the reality

The action may hurt someone. This goes against the goal of least-suffering

Example: by not accepting the past, one may suffer because of regret
